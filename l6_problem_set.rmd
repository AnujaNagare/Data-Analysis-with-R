# Q1 : price vs x.
```{r}
# In this problem set, you'll continue
# to explore the diamonds data set.

# Your first task is to create a
# scatterplot of price vs x.
# using the ggplot syntax.

# This assignment is not graded and
# will be marked as correct when you submit.

# ===========================================

diamonds
summary(diamonds)

ggplot(aes(x=price, y=x), data = diamonds) + geom_line()

```

# Q2 : findings price vs x.
in general as price increases x value increases
but there are few outliers 

# Q3 : Correlations
```{r}

cor.test(diamonds$price, diamonds$x)

cor.test(diamonds$price, diamonds$y)

cor.test(diamonds$price, diamonds$z)

```

# Q4 :  price vs depth
```{r}
# Create a simple scatter plot of price vs depth.

# This assignment is not graded and
# will be marked as correct when you submit.

# ENTER YOUR CODE BELOW THIS LINE
#==================================================

ggplot(aes(x=price, y= depth), data=diamonds) + geom_point(alpha = 1)  + scale_x_continuous(breaks = 10)

```


# Q6 : typical depth range
60-63


# Q7 : cor b/w depth price
```{r}

cor.test(diamonds$depth, diamonds$price)

```

as the correlation is weak we can't use depth to predict the price of the diamond

# Q9 : price vs carat
```{r}

# Create a scatterplot of price vs carat
# and omit the top 1% of price and carat
# values.

# This assignment is not graded and
# will be marked as correct when you submit.

# ENTER YOUR CODE BELOW THIS LINE
# ========================================
ggplot(data = diamonds,aes(x = carat, y = price)) + 
  xlim(0,quantile(diamonds$carat,0.99)) +
  ylim(0,quantile(diamonds$price,0.99)) +
  geom_point()



```

# Q10 : 
```{r}
# Create a scatterplot of price vs. volume (x * y * z).
# This is a very rough approximation for a diamond's volume.

# Create a new variable for volume in the diamonds data frame.
# This will be useful in a later exercise.

# Don't make any adjustments to the plot just yet.

# This assignment is not graded and
# will be marked as correct when you submit.

with(subset(diamonds , diamonds$volume!=0 & diamonds$volume < 800), cor.test(price, volume))

```

# Q12 : 
```{r}
# Subset the data to exclude diamonds with a volume
# greater than or equal to 800. Also, exclude diamonds
# with a volume of 0. Adjust the transparency of the
# points and add a linear model to the plot. (See the
# Instructor Notes or look up the documentation of
# geom_smooth() for more details about smoothers.)

# We encourage you to think about this next question and
# to post your thoughts in the discussion section.

# Do you think this would be a useful model to estimate
# the price of diamonds? Why or why not?

# This assignment is not graded and
# will be marked as correct when you submit.

ggplot(aes(price, volume), data = subset(diamonds , diamonds$volume!=0 & diamonds$volume < 800)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth()


```


# Q13 : 
```{r}
# Use the function dplyr package
# to create a new data frame containing
# info on diamonds by clarity.

# Name the data frame diamondsByClarity

# The data frame should contain the following
# variables in this order.

#       (1) mean_price
#       (2) median_price
#       (3) min_price
#       (4) max_price
#       (5) n

# where n is the number of diamonds in each
# level of clarity.

# This assignment WILL BE automatically
# graded!
